# Boilerplate-Fullstack-React-Express-Sequelize-Postgres

- This is a completely configured, working, and functional boilerplate configuration of a fullstack React App made available to anyone who wished to build a React app with a backend

- This repo solves the issue of create-react-app requiring its own server, which would have to contact another server for an API you build

  - This makes create-react-app not suitable for use with a backend
  
  - Feel free to clone this repo to solve this issue :)
