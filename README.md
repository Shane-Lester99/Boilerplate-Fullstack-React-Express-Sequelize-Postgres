# Boilerplate-Fullstack-React-Express-Sequelize-Postgres

- This is a completely configured, working, and functional boilerplate fullstack React App made available to anyone who wished to build a React app with a backend using Node/Express, Sequelize, and Postgres.

- This repo solves the issue of create-react-app requiring its own server, which would have to contact another server for an API you build

  - This makes create-react-app not suitable for use with a backend
  
  - Feel free to clone this repo to solve this issue :)
  
## How to use:

- After cloning this repo, make sure to install all the dependencies:

$> npm install

- Now to run the app, make sure to run command in root directory to serve the application:

$> npm run start-dev

- This will use babel and webpack to create a bundle.js file which will be sent to your client to serve the React application

- This will also use nodemon to allow for the browser to refresh after each save of a file.
